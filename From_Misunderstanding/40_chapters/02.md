# Chapter 2 — The Social Physics Behind "Truth"

## Dependence shapes belief
- A junior employee publicly supports a decision they privately doubt (job security).
- Someone downplays climate concerns at a family dinner (emotional/financial reliance).
- A public figure echoes party lines to sustain their network.

## Freedom without legitimacy is ignored
- A homeless person’s valid critique is dismissed as irrelevant.
- A child calls out hypocrisy (“But you said not to lie!”) and is gently ignored.
- Whistleblowers aren’t believed until validated by status.

**Key insight:** What we call “truth” often tracks dependencies and recognition, not just evidence.
