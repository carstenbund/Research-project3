# Chapter 4 — Integrity, Motive, and Speed of Change

## Integrity is context-rated
- In fast tech, quick pivots are praised; sticking too long = “inflexible.”
- In trades/farming, standing by your word earns trust over generations.
- Campaigners are expected to adapt to polls; religious leaders to uphold doctrine.

## We judge actions by perceived intent
- A parent bends rules for a child’s well-being (respected); for self-gain (criticized).
- A politician’s policy shift: learning or pandering?
- A celebrity’s activism: sincere or performative?

## “The greater good” is contested terrain
- Restrictions “for public safety” vs. “government overreach.”
- Environmental policy vs. jobs in carbon-heavy sectors—both claim the good.
- Families clash over “what’s best” for an aging parent.

**Key insight:** Disagreement often hides mismatched clocks (speed), yardsticks (integrity), and lenses (motive, good).
