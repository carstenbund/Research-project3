# Chapter 4 — Integrity, Motive, and Speed of Change

We often assume integrity and speed should align, yet different worlds honor different tempos. Arguments flare when we judge by our own clock without seeing the motives and values steering the other side.

## Integrity is context-rated

**Integrity** is staying aligned with your declared principles. [[Glossary: Integrity]] But what counts as “staying true” depends on the field you play in. In fast tech, investors cheer a quick pivot; lingering is branded **inflexible**. On a family farm, the handshake agreement lives for years, and breaking it brands you untrustworthy. Campaign strategists expect to chase polls, yet a pastor who constantly shifts doctrine loses the very flock seeking steadiness.

*Vignette (work):* A start‑up scrapped its entire app after a competitor launched first. The team celebrated the move as smart agility. In the neighboring repair shop, the owner watched and shook his head; in his trade, you finish the job you promised, even if trends change.

*Vignette (family):* Marta’s grandfather still works the orchard. He tells her, “Our word is our harvest.” When a supplier delays payment, he refuses a lucrative new contract with them, choosing slow security over quick cash.

*Vignette (civic):* On the campaign trail, a candidate shifts her stance on zoning after listening to residents. Some voters praise her openness; others accuse her of chasing headlines. Meanwhile the town priest sticks to an unpopular teaching, insisting that stability is the truest care.

## We judge actions by perceived intent

**Motive** is the reason we believe drives a choice. [[Glossary: Motive]] The same move can look noble or self‑serving depending on the story we assign to it.

*Vignette (family):* A father lets his teenager borrow the car past curfew to attend a friend’s memorial. The family sees compassion. When he later grants the same privilege so he can watch a game undisturbed, they call it hypocrisy.

*Vignette (civic):* A politician reverses her vote on a policing bill. Supporters cite new evidence; opponents say she’s pandering to donors. Truth may lie in both, but perception cements the label.

*Vignette (work):* A CEO announces a round of layoffs alongside a bonus plan. She frames it as protecting the company, yet staff whisper that stock options influenced the timing.

## “The greater good” is contested terrain

**Greater good** names the collective benefit we claim to serve when trade‑offs bite. [[Glossary: Greater Good]] Because values vary, so do the maps of what counts as “good.”

*Vignette (civic):* Officials restrict movement during a public health crisis. Some applaud the lifesaving measure; others call it government overreach. Both groups claim to defend freedom.

*Vignette (work):* A region debates shutting a coal plant. Environmental advocates point to cleaner air; workers fear losing generational jobs. Each argues for community welfare from a different axis.

*Vignette (family):* Siblings argue over placing their mother in assisted living. One sees professional care as dignity; another views staying home as loyalty. Each calls their choice “what’s best.”

**Key insight:** Disagreement often hides mismatched clocks (speed), yardsticks (integrity), and lenses (motive, good).

**Reflection questions**
1. Which contexts shape your sense of integrity, and where might others use a different yardstick?
2. When you claim the greater good, whose values are you privileging?
