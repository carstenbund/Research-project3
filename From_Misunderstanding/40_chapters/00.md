# Chapter 0 — Personal Core and the Roots of Truth

## Our personal core shapes what feels true
- Our **personal core**—the values and stories that anchor identity—guides what we treat as real.
- A teenager raised on open debate trusts dialogue over hierarchy.
- Someone taught to "keep the peace" equates silence with safety.

## Truth emerges where core meets shared reality
- Street facts can differ from textbook facts until a shared test settles them.
- A scientist trusts peer review; a pastor trusts scripture and lived witness.

## Society layers rules to secure survival
- When food and shelter are scarce, groups enforce sharing and safety (see **Maslow's pyramid**, a model of needs from basics to purpose).
- Once secure, norms branch into belonging, esteem, and self-actualization.

## People belong to a tribe in two ways
- **Tribe**: a group with shared norms and identity.
- **Born into the bond**: a child inherits a family, clan, or nation with preset roles and protections.
- **Join a tribe**: an adult chooses a new community—online guild, profession, congregation—seeking a better fit with their core.

**Key insight:** Knowing your core, testing truth together, and choosing aligned tribes opens the path to higher ground.
