# Chapter 6 — How to Climb Toward Higher Common Ground

1) Make meanings explicit.

"When I say soon, I mean within 15 minutes. What does soon mean to you?"

2) Name dependencies to de-bias truth.

"Part of my stance is shaped by my role/team/family. Here’s where I’m not free—and where I am."

3) Rebalance the adaptation load.
Leaders: ask for unfiltered feedback; juniors: request a turn to set terms.

"For five minutes, could we use my definitions and then yours?"

4) Surface motives without accusation.

"I want to check intent: are we changing course because we learned, or because optics changed?"

5) Separate speed from integrity.

"What must stay non-negotiable, and what can pivot fast? Let’s make two lists."

6) Map the ‘greater good’ explicitly.
Put values on a board (safety, freedom, jobs, environment, dignity). Mark trade-offs you accept and why.

"Which value wins in a tie, and for how long?"

7) Build a small shared charter.
Three to five principles you’ll enact now (e.g., “steel-man the other side before critiquing,” “timestamp claims,” “own dependency disclosures,” “seek disconfirming feedback once per decision”).

8) Create a feedback loop that can reach the top.
Schedule a short, recurring “ground truth” session where lower-power participants set the agenda.
