# Chapter 6 — How to Climb Toward Higher Common Ground

These eight moves translate the book’s insights into actions you can try tomorrow. Coming down from our search for a common sky, practised lightly but often, they build the muscle of shared integrity.

1) **Make meanings explicit.** Clarify terms upfront to shrink ambiguity.

"When I say soon, I mean within 15 minutes. What does soon mean to you?"

2) **Name dependencies to de-bias truth.** Share the pressures shaping your stance.

"Part of my stance is shaped by my role/team/family. Here’s where I’m not free—and where I am."

3) **Rebalance the adaptation load.** Share the burden of adjusting.
Leaders: ask for unfiltered feedback; juniors: request a turn to set terms.

"For five minutes, could we use my definitions and then yours?"

4) **Surface motives without accusation.** Check intentions before judging.

"I want to check intent: are we changing course because we learned, or because optics changed?"

5) **Separate speed from integrity.** Decide what is fixed and what can flex.

"What must stay non-negotiable, and what can pivot fast? Let’s make two lists."

6) **Map the ‘greater good’ explicitly.** Make values and trade-offs visible.
Put values on a board (safety, freedom, jobs, environment, dignity). Mark trade-offs you accept and why.

"Which value wins in a tie, and for how long?"

7) **Build a small shared charter.** Commit to a few principles you’ll enact now.
Three to five principles you’ll enact now (e.g., “steel-man the other side before critiquing,” “timestamp claims,” “own dependency disclosures,” “seek disconfirming feedback once per decision”).

8) **Create a feedback loop that can reach the top.** Give lower-power voices a regular path to speak.
Schedule a short, recurring “ground truth” session where lower-power participants set the agenda.

With practice, these moves converge into a quick checklist—a simple flow you can keep on hand, outlined next.

**Reflection questions**
1. Which move feels easiest to try in your next conversation?
2. How could you invite others to practice one of these moves with you?
