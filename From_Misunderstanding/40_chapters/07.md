# Chapter 7 — A Simple Flow You Can Use Tomorrow

When time is tight, this seven-step checklist keeps conversations grounded. Distilling the eight moves into a portable form, you can run through it in order or grab the step you need most.

1. Clarify terms (close the ambiguity gap).
2. Disclose dependencies (explain your pressures).
3. Balance adaptation (share the burden of adjusting).
4. Check motives (learning vs. optics).
5. Pin integrity vs. speed (what’s fixed, what flexes).
6. Chart the greater good (name values, trade-offs, time horizon).
7. Agree on a mini-charter + loop (principles you’ll actually practice, and when you’ll revisit them).

**Reflection questions**
1. Which step do you tend to skip, and what happens when you do?
2. Who could benefit from keeping this flow handy alongside you?

> Quick 1–5 “symbolic temperature” vote before closing. If ≥4, compress the story in one sentence and do a grace bid.
> Higher ground: Close hot loops cool; cool loops compound trust.
