# Chapter 1 — Why Misunderstanding Happens (Naturally)

## Different defaults, same words
- “I’ll be there soon” can mean 10 minutes to one person and an hour to another.
- “We’re on the same page” often hides an unspoken framework; if it’s not actually shared, friction follows.
- Traffic rules work because people broadly accept them, not just because they’re written.

## We smooth things over to keep flow
- A friend misremembers your story; you let it go because it’s not the point.
- In cross-cultural talk, you overlook small errors to stay connected.
- At work, you don’t nitpick a minor misinterpretation to preserve goodwill.

**Key insight:** Misunderstanding is baked in by ambiguity and social smoothing. It’s not moral failure; it’s how humans maintain momentum.
