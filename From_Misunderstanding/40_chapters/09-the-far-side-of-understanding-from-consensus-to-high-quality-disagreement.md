# Chapter 8 — The Far Side of Understanding — From Consensus to High-Quality Disagreement

Mutual legibility does not always lead to agreement. Its true purpose is often more profound: to enable high-quality disagreement.

This chapter reframes the goal from finding a single "higher ground" to building multiple, well-understood paths forward.
