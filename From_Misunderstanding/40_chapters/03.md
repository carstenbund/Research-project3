# Chapter 3 — Power Tilts the Conversation

Power shapes conversations long before words are spoken. Following the social tugs on truth, who bends and who sets the terms depends on where each person stands on the gradient of influence. Naming that slope lets us redistribute the effort of adapting.

## Who adapts to whom?

**Adaptation load** is the effort required to adjust to someone else’s language, mood, or rules. [[Glossary: Adaptation Load]] Those with less leverage carry more of it. They scan faces, rehearse phrases, and swallow reactions to keep things smooth.

*Vignette (work):* A waitress endures a customer’s sarcasm with a practiced smile. Her tip—and shift—depends on staying gracious, while the customer feels free to vent without consequence.

*Vignette (family):* Eight-year-old Jonah studies his mother’s expression before asking for playtime. If her shoulders sag, he backs away. The adults rarely adjust to his moods; he is the one calibrating.

*Vignette (civic):* At a town hall, volunteer organizers rearrange agendas whenever the mayor is late. They whisper reminders to speak respectfully, knowing one misstep could cost future support.

## Power can isolate

**Power gradient** describes how far someone sits from everyday consequences. [[Glossary: Power Gradient]] The steeper the gradient, the more filtered their feedback becomes.

*Vignette (work):* A CEO tours the factory floor after a glowing quarterly report. Workers have been meeting quotas by skipping breaks, but supervisors highlight only success. The top hears applause, not strain.

*Vignette (civic):* A celebrity tweets about a budget-friendly recipe, unaware that the suggested ingredients cost more than many families spend in a week. Years of assistants and catered sets have dulled her price sense.

*Vignette (family):* Grandma Rosa insists the household is “just fine” while her grandchildren quietly handle repairs and bills she no longer sees. Her authority shields her from the mess that others tidy up.

**Key insight:** The higher you are in a gradient, the less you must adapt—and the less you hear.

With power dynamics on the table, we can look more closely at how questions of integrity, motive, and speed spark conflict.

**Reflection questions**
1. Where do you carry adaptation load, and where do others carry it for you?
2. How might you reduce the power gradient in a conversation you lead?
