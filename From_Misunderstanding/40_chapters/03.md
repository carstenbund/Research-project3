# Chapter 3 — How Power Assigns the Adaptation Load

Power shapes conversations long before words are spoken. Following the social tugs on truth, who bends and who sets the terms depends on where each person stands on the gradient of influence. Naming that slope lets us redistribute the effort of adapting.

## Who adapts to whom?

**Adaptation load** is the effort required to adjust to someone else’s language, mood, or rules. [[Glossary: Adaptation Load]] Those with less leverage carry more of it.

*Vignette (work):* A waitress endures a customer’s sarcasm with a practiced smile. Her tip—and shift—depends on staying gracious, while the customer feels free to vent without consequence.

## Public roles magnify the slope

*Vignette (civic):* At a town hall, volunteer organizers rearrange agendas whenever the mayor is late. They whisper reminders to speak respectfully, knowing one misstep could cost future support.

## Power can isolate

**Power gradient** describes how far someone sits from everyday consequences. [[Glossary: Power Gradient]] The steeper the gradient, the more filtered their feedback becomes.

*Vignette (family):* Grandma Rosa insists the household is “just fine” while her grandchildren quietly handle repairs and bills she no longer sees. Her authority shields her from the mess that others tidy up.

Side notes: A CEO tours the factory floor after a glowing report and hears only praise; a celebrity tweets a “budget” recipe that outstrips most families’ grocery money.

**Key insight:** Power lowers the need to adapt and raises the risk of not hearing.

**Reflection questions**
1. Where do you carry adaptation load, and where do others carry it for you?
2. How might you reduce the power gradient in a conversation you lead?

> **Symbolic Hint → Higher Ground**
> Name the adaptation load explicitly; agree to share it for a block of time.
> Higher ground: Rotate who sets definitions for five minutes; watch isolation drop.

With the slope visible, disagreements over integrity, motive, and speed become legible, not personal.
