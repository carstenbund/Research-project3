# Chapter 3 — Power Tilts the Conversation

## Who adapts to whom?
- A waitress smiles through rudeness; the customer feels no need to adjust.
- Junior staff modulate tone; leaders speak freely.
- Children read adult moods; adults rarely adapt to children.

## Power can isolate
- A CEO misses ground realities because feedback gets filtered.
- Celebrities sound tone-deaf from long-term distance to everyday life.
- Politicians overestimate support when advisors curate their inputs.

**Key insight:** The higher you are in a gradient, the less you must adapt—and the less you hear.
