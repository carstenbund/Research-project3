# Chapter 4 — The Ruptured Channel — When Trauma Overrides Translation

Sometimes, the lines aren't just crossed; they're down. Trauma is not a point of view; it's a physiological state of defense that hijacks the brain's capacity for translation. When someone is operating from a fight, flight, or freeze response, their goal is not legibility—it's safety. Pushing for clarity in this state can feel like an attack. This chapter explores how to recognize a ruptured channel and understand that the first step is not to repair the conversation, but to re-establish a felt sense of safety.
