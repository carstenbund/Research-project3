# Chapter 2 — How Dependency and Recognition Bend "Truth"

Truth feels solid, yet it bends with the pressures around us. Building on the everyday mismatches we just traced, each stance we take is tugged by debts, loyalties, and how others rate our right to speak. Seeing these forces helps us test claims without denying the people who hold them.

## Dependence shapes belief

**Dependency** is the web of practical or emotional pressures that make some opinions safer than others. [[Glossary: Dependency]] When your rent, reputation, or belonging hinges on agreement, dissent can feel reckless. So we nod along, even as our inner compass shakes.

*Vignette (family):* At Thanksgiving, Uncle Ray turned the conversation to climate policy. Maya had researched rising sea levels for class, yet her parents’ small business relied on a coal contract. She softened her language, afraid blunt facts might sound like betrayal of the family livelihood.

## Debts steer public stance

Public roles carry their own dependencies. A city councilmember privately questioned her party’s zoning stance. Developers funded her next campaign, and neighborhood activists were watching. On record, she echoed the party line, telling herself she’d push for tweaks once re‑elected.

## Recognition decides whose truth lands

**Legitimacy** is the recognition that a voice counts. [[Glossary: Legitimacy]] You can speak freely, but if others don’t see you as credible, your words fall through the floor. Status, credentials, and social location grant some statements weight while others evaporate.

*Vignette (work):* When technician Omar raised safety concerns, management brushed him off. Months later a consultant issued the same warning with a polished report, and the company launched an urgent fix. Omar’s freedom to speak had never been enough.

Side note: During a public hearing, a man experiencing homelessness described dangerous shelter conditions. Officials thanked him and moved on until a nonprofit director repeated the same points.

**Key insight:** Truth rides on debt and recognition before it ever rides on data.

**Reflection questions**
1. Where do dependencies in your life nudge you toward silence or agreement?
2. Who do you dismiss as unqualified, and what might change if you granted them legitimacy?

> **Symbolic Hint → Higher Ground**
> Ask for lineage: “What repo did this belief come from, and what did you change?”
> Higher ground: Recognition rises when you mirror someone’s change-log accurately.

Recognition decides whose truth lands; power decides who must bend to deliver it.
