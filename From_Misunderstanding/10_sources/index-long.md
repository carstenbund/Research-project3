# Source Index (Expanded)

Extended summaries of available source notes to support chapter development and meta-layer translation.

## born_into_the_bound.md

[born_into_the_bound.md](born_into_the_bound.md) examines responsibility as something inherited rather than chosen. It describes how affect acts as an emotional infrastructure that installs duty before conscious agreement, making dissent feel like betrayal of kinship. The essay also warns that apparent common ground in such settings is often fabricated through emotional conditioning. Useful for Chapters 2–4 on power and belonging and Layer 2 cues about emotional inheritance.

## grace_and_gravity.md

[grace_and_gravity.md](grace_and_gravity.md) contrasts educated reliance on explicit systems with the performative power of tribal structures. It argues that legibility is a fantasy and that ritual and loyalty often govern real influence. The piece outlines an epistemic divide between transparent rule‑following and embodied symbolic authority. Feeds Chapters 2–3 on social physics and a Layer 2 sidebar on "grace and gravity." 

## justice.md

[justice.md](justice.md) frames justice as the structural gravity that holds reality together, distinguishing it from truth as mere fact. It maps a gradient from absolute justice to performative adaptation, showing how compassion creates symbolic shelter but also accumulates field debt. This analysis supports Chapter 5 on universal layers and informs Layer 3 reflections on reconciliation and return paths.

## join_a_tribe.md

[join_a_tribe.md](join_a_tribe.md) explores initiation as a mechanism of epistemic captivity. Ritual entry appears voluntary but installs a truth system that feels irrevocable, binding identity to duty through affective scaffolding. The note uses the Mythic Epistemology Model (MEM) to trace how loyalty precedes thought and how exit becomes symbolic treason. Relevant to Chapters 2–3 on truth and power and Layer 2 notes on symbolic loyalty.

## mem.md

[mem.md](mem.md) introduces the **Mythic Epistemology Model**, a five‑pillar framework for how societies construct and perform truth. It covers the rational core, post‑binary coherence, affective infrastructure, collapse of authority, and the sovereignty of the unreasonable. The model underpins all chapters and anchors both Layer 2 symbolic hints and Layer 3 practitioner protocols.

## personal-core.md

[personal-core.md](personal-core.md) delves into the **Rational Core** as an existential compass seeking coherence. It outlines three axes—personal truth, intersubjective truth, and objective fidelity—and shows how grace and gravity pull this compass. Material here supports Chapter 2 on social physics and Layer 2 sidebars on personal truth and internal alignment.

## Symbolic_Field_Theory.md

[Symbolic_Field_Theory.md](Symbolic_Field_Theory.md) sketches a nine‑part theory linking affect, identity, and narrative into a symbolic field. Sections cover topics such as symbolic attractors, entropy and grace, archetypal memory, and the symbolic thermometer. This document is a primary source for Layer 2 symbolic hints across all chapters.

## theology_redefined.md

[theology_redefined.md](theology_redefined.md) reframes divinity as the recursive infrastructure of coherence rather than a supernatural agent. It interprets sacred language as a compression function that stores and transmits symbolic patterns across generations. This translation helps bridge religious and secular worldviews, feeding Chapters 2 and 5 and informing Layer 2 cues on belief.

## where_truth_comes_from.md

[where_truth_comes_from.md](where_truth_comes_from.md) is a reflective essay on the origins and lived experience of truth. It traces how personal feeling, social roles, and resistance to erasure shape our sense of what is real. The note introduces MEM as a tool for mapping these layers of truth and supports the project introduction and Layer 3 orientation.
