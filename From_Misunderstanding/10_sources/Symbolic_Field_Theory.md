here I use the personal core and other texts to tie them together to sketch a connection, use this to help create layer 2

---

## **Section I: The Pre-Symbolic Substrate**

**Title:** _“Feeling Before Form: The Affective Root of Symbolic Trust”_

- Somatic gradients (warmth, rupture, rhythm) as preconditions to language
- Coherence as a pre-symbolic, felt experience
- Embodied epistemology: touch and tone as the original grammar
