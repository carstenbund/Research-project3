essay on where truth comes from


## Where Does Truth Come From?

Everyone has a sense of what truth is.  
It has always been so, and it will likely always remain.  
And yet, even the word "truth" is unclear in its meaning.

Which truth are we speaking of?

Is it the truth  
of living together,  
of recognizing patterns, recurring appearances, the laws behind them?  
The truth of survival – breathing, eating, sustaining oneself?  
Depending on where you stand, truth takes a different form.

Social frameworks often overshadow what we might call "real" truth.  
Reality – is it the same as truth?

Or is truth something that keeps shifting,  
something we feel before we can define it,  
something that sometimes matters more than what we see with our own eyes?

Sometimes truth is a promise we make to one another.  
Sometimes it is a tool that protects us.  
And sometimes it is a mirror, showing us more about ourselves than about the world.

How does truth emerge in a world that changes faster than we can follow?  
Which truth remains when old certainties collapse?  
Who decides which voice counts, which image endures, which path is right?

Perhaps it is not about finding a final answer.  
Perhaps it is about understanding **how** truth lives within us,  
how it grows, how it changes, how it binds us together or pulls us apart.

When we ask these questions —  
when we take up the thread between feeling, experience, and recognition —  
a journey begins.  
Not a journey toward absolute answers,  
but toward a deeper sense of **what truth means for us**.

You can try to grasp truth solely through facts.  
Or you can sense that truth is always also an inner fabric —  
woven from thoughts, feelings, expectations, and decisions.

This fabric cannot be reduced to a formula.  
But it can be traced, layer by layer.  
And if we look carefully,  
we find recurring patterns:  
structures that shape our sense of truth long before any word is spoken,  
before any judgment is made.

Recognizing these structures does not mean simplifying them.  
It means stepping into the inner space where thinking, feeling, and judging begin.

**MEM** — the **Mythic Epistemology Model** — attempts exactly this:  
not to dictate truth,  
but to make visible the hidden layers of how we experience it.

Without claiming final answers —  
but with the wish to understand **how** we believe, **why** we believe,  
and **what** moves within us when we do.

Let’s look closer.


## 1. **Inner Compass**

**↳ Where personal truth begins**

Before any truth becomes public — before it is debated, defended, or doubted —  
it first lives privately, inside you.

It begins within:  
in that felt sense of what resonates as right,  
in what you believe,  
in what you may question but still cannot easily set aside.

Your inner compass stirs — sometimes loudly, sometimes so quietly you almost miss it —  
long before words are found or proofs are gathered.

For some, this compass points mainly toward what they **feel**.  
For others, it points toward what they can **verify**: logic, evidence, demonstrable connections.  
Both belong together.  
Whether you trust feeling or seek verification first —  
your inner compass decides what can stand as "true" for you.

> _Where does my sense of truth come from — what feels genuine, what do I truly believe, what can I ground in evidence?_

Without this inner starting point,  
it becomes difficult to understand why anyone believes anything at all —  
or how truth forms in the first place.

**In psychology**, this touches on the idea of **self-congruence** —  
the wish for alignment between your self-image, your experiences, and your actions.  
It is about not being torn apart inside:  
between what you feel, what you think, and what you present to the world.

**For reflection:**

- Do I rely more on my gut feeling — or do I need clear external validation before I accept something as true?
- Have I ever stood by truths that felt right to me, even if others could not understand or accept them?
- Where do I feel tension between what I know and what I believe?



## 2. **Living Multilayered Truths**

**↳ How we stay ourselves across many layers**

You are not just one role.  
Not just the version of you that others expect to see.  
You are many — and that is not a contradiction.

At work, you speak differently than with your friends.  
In your family, you may think differently than you do alone in a quiet moment.  
Sometimes you find yourself between competing loyalties, memories, expectations —  
and yet you remain yourself.

Living multilayered truths means:  
You don’t have to commit to a single version of yourself.  
You can live through contradictions without losing your core.  
Your truth can shift — depending on where you are, who you're with, and what matters most in that moment —  
and still stay **coherent within**.

> _How can I stay true to myself when my truth changes with context?_

This inner flexibility protects you from clinging too tightly to any one role —  
or from breaking when one of those roles falls away.

**In psychology**, this touches on the concept of **self-complexity** —  
the idea that having many facets makes us stronger and more resilient.  
Not because we are unstable —  
but because we carry more than one truth within us.

**For reflection:**

- Do I experience my own complexity as a richness — or as a burden?
- How do I stay whole across different areas of my life?
- Which roles support my sense of self — and which ones pull me away from it?


## 3. **Feelings Shaped by the World**

**↳ How social structures shape our sense of truth**

Feelings do not arise from nowhere.  
They are responses — shaped by a world that has already left its mark on us.

A world that not only teaches us rules,  
but also shapes the feelings that tell us what seems right,  
what belongs,  
and what feels out of place.

What you feel when you belong,  
and what you feel when you don't —  
is not just private.  
It is the echo of an order that lives in your environment:  
unspoken, but deeply felt.

> _How can I recognize what my society holds as true?_  
> _By sensing what resonates within me — and what resists._

Our feelings act like inner instruments, tuned by the world around us.  
They reveal which truths are recognized in the spaces we inhabit —  
even if no one ever speaks them aloud.

**In psychology**, this is described through concepts like **somatic markers** (Antonio Damasio) —  
bodily-anchored feelings that prepare and guide decisions —  
and **affect logic** (Ciompi),  
which shows how thinking and feeling are inseparably intertwined within social fields.

**For reflection:**

- Which feelings tell me I am part of something — and which feelings tell me I am outside?
- Where can I trace the imprints of socially shaped truths within myself?
- Can I tell when my feeling reflects my own truth — and when it echoes the world around me?

---

When outer truths collapse, when trust is shaken,  
we often retreat, seeking our own center.

But sometimes retreat is not enough.  
Sometimes, there must be a response.  
A response that does not simply repeat the old rules, but says:  
_I am no longer playing your game._

This response does not always sound reasonable.  
Sometimes it comes as absurdity, irony, mystery — and it is true precisely because of that.

## 5. **When Nonsense Becomes Shelter**

**↳ How we respond to erasure with irony, myth, and absurdity**

When you are erased,  
you may no longer answer with arguments.  
Not with logic, not with explanations.  
But with something that cannot be seized:  
Absurdity, humor, myth.

> _If there is no place for me in your world — why should I still speak its language?_

Nonsense can be protection.  
A way of refusing to be absorbed.  
A way of saying:  
_I will not let myself be reduced by your rules._

When outer systems fail you or cast you out,  
the unreasonable can become a way to guard your inner sovereignty.  
Not because you lose contact with reality —  
but because you defend your own.

**In psychology**, this connects to **ironic defense mechanisms** (Freud),  
to **dissociative protection strategies**,  
and to **symbolic protest**, as seen in art, parody, and the refusal of dominant language.  
It also resonates with the concept of **narrative defiance** —  
where meaning itself is reshaped as an act of survival.

**For reflection:**

- Where have I protected myself through irony, humor, or "safe nonsense"?
- Which "crazy" responses were actually wise shields against a world that did not see me?
- How can I use the unreasonable as a creative form of self-preservation?

## Final Reflection

We still do not know where truth comes from.  
And that’s all right.

MEM does not try to close that gap.  
It simply shows that movement can arise from uncertainty.

That we can continue.  
Despite confusion.  
Despite contradictions.  
Despite the pull of the world around us.

With what has been outlined here,  
you can recognize the dynamic — and use it.

Not to shield yourself.  
But to avoid being swept away.

Without guilt.  
Without the need for completeness.  
Only with the willingness to move.

**Truth is movement.  
And you are in the midst of it**
